## List of differences
* In the original there was a ramp at the left of the map, under the purple one. In our game the ramp is blocked.
* The lights that do not score are not implemented in our game, except from the pink arrow sequence.
* In order to make the score clearer, the game uses a different typography from the original.
* When the player loses all lifes, Game Over appears in the screen for 1-2 seconds and the platyer can't use the controls. In the original game, it pauses and shows the player the TOP scores.
* In the original game there's a yellow circle that teleports the ball. In our game it does not exist.

## Combo implemenetd
* When three lights of the same color are lit, they will turn off and the player will receive score points.
